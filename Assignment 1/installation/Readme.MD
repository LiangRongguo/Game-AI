We provide an Anacoda YAML file to provide a clean python environment in which to run the game engine. 

1. Download miniconda or anaconda 
2. Save environment_gameai_yml.yaml to a directory of your choice
3. Run the following in the directory you saved the YAML file
```conda env create -f environment_gameai_yml.yaml```
4. Start the environment:
```source activate gameai```

# Test the basic game engine

```python runbasic.py```
